# Linear Regression with Python

Introduction:

Linear Regression is one of the most widely used algorithms in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It's a fundamental concept that enables us to model relationships between variables and make predictions based on historical data. In this project, we'll dive into implementing Linear Regression using Python and Numpy, focusing on the practical application of gradient descent for regression problems.

Through this hands-on project-based course, I aim to build a comprehensive understanding of how Linear Regression works, from formulating the model to training it with gradient descent. By working through this project, I expect to gain a deeper insight into the optimization algorithm and the training process, which will be essential in my future endeavors in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Specifically, I'll explore:

* Formulation of the Linear Regression model
* Training the model using gradient descent
* Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared)
* Implementation of regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

This project will not only provide me with practical experience in implementing Linear Regression, but also equip me with a solid foundation for further exploration in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
